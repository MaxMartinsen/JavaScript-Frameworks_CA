## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Vite-plugin-inspect

Inspect the intermediate state of Vite plugins. Useful for debugging and authoring plugins.

- [vite-plugin-inspect@v0.7.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-inspect)

## Prettier

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter

- [prettier](https://prettier.io/)

## React Router

Routing in React refers to navigating and linking between different pages in React.

- [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

## React Redux

React Redux is the official React UI bindings layer for Redux. It lets your React components read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update state.

- [react-redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)

### createAsyncThunk

A function that accepts a Redux action type string and a callback function that should return a promise. It generates promise lifecycle action types based on the action type prefix that you pass in, and returns a thunk action creator that will run the promise callback and dispatch the lifecycle actions based on the returned promise.

- [createAsyncThunk](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk)

## Redux DevTools

It is advisable to use it to work with the application.

Redux DevTools for debugging application's state changes.

The extension provides power-ups for your Redux development workflow. Apart from Redux, it can be used with any other architectures which handle the state.

This is an open source project. See the official repository for more details: - [redux-devtools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools)

## Redux Toolkit

State Management: As React applications grow, managing state across components becomes increasingly complex. Redux is a popular library for managing application state in a predictable way. [@reduxjs/toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) is the official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. It simplifies common tasks such as store setup, creating reducers, asynchronous logic, and more.

## Axios

HTTP Requests: Applications often need to communicate with external services and APIs to fetch, send, or manipulate data. [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, making it simpler to perform HTTP requests to external APIs.
