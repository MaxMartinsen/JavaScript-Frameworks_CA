## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Vite-plugin-inspect

Inspect the intermediate state of Vite plugins. Useful for debugging and authoring plugins.

- [vite-plugin-inspect@v0.7.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-inspect)

## Prettier

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter

- [prettier](https://prettier.io/)

## Redux Toolkit

State Management: As React applications grow, managing state across components becomes increasingly complex. Redux is a popular library for managing application state in a predictable way. [@reduxjs/toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) is the official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. It simplifies common tasks such as store setup, creating reducers, asynchronous logic, and more.

## Axios

HTTP Requests: Applications often need to communicate with external services and APIs to fetch, send, or manipulate data. [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, making it simpler to perform HTTP requests to external APIs.
